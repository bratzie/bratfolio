Half-way through the project I switched from Sublime Text 3 to Brackets as my main text editor, and so far I love it. This was the final task for the course DH2627, Interaction Design at KTH. However, since I needed some sort of refuge in the stormy sea that is the internet, I probably made more than I needed to.",
