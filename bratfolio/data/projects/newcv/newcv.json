  "description": "As I was about to graduate, when I was finishing up my master's thesis, I realized that I still had no definitive plans for where I would go after I was done with school. In order to facilitate the job hunt I had to update my CV. I knew I wanted it to fit on one page and give the employer a good quick overview of who I am while at the same time conveying that I have a good eye for design. All in all, I think the end result turned out great. And since I got the first job I applied to with the new CV, I'd say it did its job!",
  "reflection": "I think the project turned out very good and it felt great to finally have a CV that I was proud of.",
  "process": "I had a pretty good plan thought out before I sat down to design the CV. I sketched it out on paper and I was sure that I wanted to display my experience in some form of timeline. Since I wanted the CV to relate to my digital CV (found on this site) I used the same iconography and fonts. After a few hours in photoshop, the final CV was complete.",
  "links": "No links for this project.",
  "information": "When searching for a job, the difference between a good or bad CV makes or breaks your application. I saw the need to update mine and did so accordingly."
