            <p>Throughout the years I have managed to do some projects. This is the place where I store a subsection of them in order for other people to enjoy! For the time being, the projects will be related to different courses at school as well as some projects done in my spare time. By using the search field to the right you will be able to search for titles or keywords that you might be interested in.</p>
